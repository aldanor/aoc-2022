# aoc-2022

Advent of Code 2022 -- highly optimized Rust solutions.

These are the benchmark results taken on Apple M1 laptop (these include the time to parse input for
each part of each problem - there are no input 'generators' and so each input is parsed twice):

```
day       part 1    part 2    
------------------------------
day 01    6.52 μs   6.51 μs   
day 02    0.30 μs   0.30 μs   
------------------------------
```
